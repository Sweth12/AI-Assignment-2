# Predict-stock-market-prices-with-sentiment-analysis-on-news-data

The goal of the project is to predict the uncertain stock market prices with the help of sentiment analysis of news data. 
Which is done by initially scrapping the news data from New York times using the newsapi.org API. Then perform sentiment analysis on the data using natural language toolkit. 
And finally train the data using models Na√Øve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forests and finally observe the actual prices against predicted prices of the stocks.
